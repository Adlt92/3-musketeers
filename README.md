The library [cash](./cash) that we need to

* write the README.md

The library [star-wars](./star-wars) that we need to


* write Unit Tests (with Jest as testing framework)


## Just tell me what to do

```sh
❯ cd /path/to/workspace
❯ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/3-musketeers.git
```

* commit your different modifications:

```sh
❯ cd /path/to/workspace/3-musketeers
❯ git add -A && git commit -m "docs(readme): describe how to use cash"
